## DATA STRUCTURES

1. Linked List: 
- contains nodes (value + pointer)
- head and tail structure
- good at adding / deleting nodes
- not as good at retrieval or searching

2. Arrays: 
- contiguous memory
- good at retrieving items 
- sometimes bad at adding new items

3. Hash Table
- dictionary in Python
- key to hashing function to return memory location
- possible collisions
- good a retrieving and adding

4. Stack and Queue
- Stack LIFO, call stack, Depth First Search (DFS)
- Queue: Breadth First Search (BFS)

5. Graphs and Trees
- weights and edges
- trees with parents and children
- binary search tree
- could be unbalanced
